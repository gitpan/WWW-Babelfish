Revision history for Perl extension WWW::Babelfish.

0.01  Tue Apr 20 20:43:40 1999
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

0.02	Thu May  6 20:42:35 1999  
	- added code to break up source text by paragraph
	and reassemble it. This looks nicer in the output
	and Babelfish seems to like it better.

	- bug fixes for accidental appending of source text, 
	multiple linefeeds, and timeouts. Also added demo code
	to test.pl
