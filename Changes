Revision history for Perl extension WWW::Babelfish.

0.01  Tue Apr 20 20:43:40 1999
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

0.02	Thu May  6 20:42:35 1999  
	- added code to break up source text by paragraph
	and reassemble it. This looks nicer in the output
	and Babelfish seems to like it better.

0.03	Tue May 18 20:04:45 1999
	- bug fixes for accidental appending of source text, 
	multiple linefeeds, and timeouts. Also added demo code
	to test.pl

0.04	Wed Jan  5 16:33:11 2000
	- Added proxy support and support for input/output filehandles
	using IO::String to maintain backwards compatibility; now we
	can translate whole novels! Added support for user-specified
	paragraph delimiters. Some code clean-up.

0.05	Thu Feb 10 14:48:10 2000
	- Added improved test code and changed "deliminators" to
	"delimiters" so I look like less of an idiot.
