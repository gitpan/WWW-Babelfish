WWW::Babelfish, version .09

STATUS
======
This is ALPHA software; use at your own risk. 

Comments, bug reports, patches etc. are appreciated.

DESCRIPTION
===========
This module is a simple perl front-end to the Babelfish translation
server.  It's more fun than useful, but it might have a place in
IRC/talk clients or perhaps a translating web proxy. It makes an
attempt at breaking longer pieces of text up into chunks that
Babelfish can handle and then reassembling them.

I think the Babelfish server itself is a wonderfully audacious hack
and much more could be done along these lines, especially if there was 
some sort of user feedback mechanism. There's a great free software
project here for someone who knows something about linguistics (not
me). 

INSTALLATION
============
This module needs the following modules, all available from CPAN:

HTTP::Request    (in the libwww-perl bundle)
LWP::UserAgent   (in the libwww-perl bundle)
HTML::TokeParser (in the libwww-perl bundle)
IO::String

After unpacking the tar file, do the usual:

        perl Makefile.PL 
        make
	make test
        make install

There is embedded POD documentation in Babelfish.pm
